## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning (Developer Input)
**Developer Action**: Create or update `PLANNING.md` with new feature descriptions
- **Content**: Non-technical, user-facing feature descriptions
- **Format**: Clear, concise descriptions of what users will see/experience
- **Scope**: Complete feature set to be implemented
- **Examples**: "Users can open folders", "Users can edit files with syntax highlighting"

### Phase 2: PRP Generation (Agent Action)
**Agent Instruction**: "Read README.md and INIT.md, then generate PRPs for the features in PLANNING.md"

**Agent Requirements**:
- Read README.md and INIT.md as source of truth
- Analyze PLANNING.md for feature requirements
- Generate detailed PRP documents in `_PRP/current/`
- Follow PRP-[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[number]-[feature].md naming convention
- Include complete implementation details

**PRP Content Requirements**:
- Functional requirements (what the feature does)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- User-facing descriptions (UI/UX)
- Technical implementation details
- Code examples and references to existing codebase
- Testing requirements and coverage targets
- Potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Accessibility requirements
- Performance considerations

### Phase 3: Implementation (Agent Action)
**Agent Instruction**: "Implement all PRPs in the current folder"

**Agent Requirements**:
- **MANDATORY**: Read README.md and INIT.md before each PRP
- **MANDATORY**: Keep working until all PRPs in 'current' folder are complete
- **MANDATORY**: Maintain >80% test coverage throughout
- **MANDATORY**: Ensure all tests pass before moving to next PRP
- **MANDATORY**: Run tests in non-watch mode: `npm run test:run`
- **MANDATORY**: Do NOT run interactive commands that could hang
- **MANDATORY**: Do NOT ask for confirmations - keep working automatically
- **MANDATORY**: Move completed PRPs to `_PRP/archive/` after implementation
- **MANDATORY**: Update archive README.md with new completed features

## Agent Instructions & Restrictions

### Before Starting Any Work:
1. **ALWAYS** read README.md and INIT.md first
2. **ALWAYS** understand the development cycle and rules
3. **ALWAYS** check current folder for active PRPs
4. **ALWAYS** verify test environment is working

### During Implementation:
1. **MANDATORY**: Follow TDD approach (tests first)
2. **MANDATORY**: Use design system tokens consistently
3. **MANDATORY**: Implement comprehensive error handling
4. **MANDATORY**: Add accessibility features
5. **MANDATORY**: Write clear documentation
6. **MANDATORY**: Test thoroughly before completion

### Testing Requirements:
1. **MANDATORY**: Run `npm run test:run` (NOT `npm test`)
2. **MANDATORY**: Ensure all tests pass before proceeding
3. **MANDATORY**: Maintain >80% test coverage
4. **MANDATORY**: Fix any test failures before moving to next PRP

### Quality Gates:
- [ ] All tests pass (>80% coverage)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No linting warnings
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved

### Completion Requirements:
1. **MANDATORY**: Move completed PRP to `_PRP/archive/`
2. **MANDATORY**: Update archive README.md with new completed features
3. **MANDATORY**: Update documentation as needed
4. **MANDATORY**: Verify no regressions in existing functionality
5. **MANDATORY**: Continue until all PRPs in 'current' are complete

## How to Provide Prompts to Agent

### For PRP Generation:
```
"Read README.md and INIT.md, then generate PRPs for the features in PLANNING.md. 
Create detailed, well-researched PRP documents in the 'current' folder that contain 
complete information about the features to be implemented, including functional requirements, 
non-functional requirements, user-facing descriptions, technical details, code examples, 
testing requirements, potential risks, and accessibility considerations. Use the naming 
convention PRP-[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[number]-[feature].md with today's date."
```

### For Implementation:
```
"Read README.md and INIT.md, then implement all PRPs in the current folder. 
Keep working until all PRPs are complete. Maintain >80% test coverage and ensure 
all tests pass. Run tests with 'npm run test:run' only. Do not ask for confirmations 
or run interactive commands. Move completed PRPs to archive when done and update 
the archive README.md with new completed features."
```

### For Feature Planning:
```
"Update PLANNING.md with the following user-facing feature descriptions: [describe features]. 
Focus on what users will experience, not technical implementation details."
```

## PRP Naming Convention

### Format: `PRP-[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[number]-[feature].md`

**Examples:**
- `PRP-2024-01-15-01-Design-System-Testing-Foundation.md`
- `PRP-2024-01-15-02-Setup.md`
- `PRP-2024-01-15-03-UI-Skeleton.md`

**Components:**
- `[YYYY]`: Four-digit year
- `[MM]`: Two-digit month (01-12)
- `[DD]`: Two-digit day (01-31)
- `[number]`: Sequential number within the feature set (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- `[feature]`: Descriptive feature name (kebab-case)

**Benefits:**
- Files sort chronologically in filesystem
- Clear date tracking for feature sets
- Sequential numbering within feature sets
- Descriptive feature names for easy identification

## File Descriptions

### Core Files
- **README.md**: This file - complete workflow instructions
- **INIT.md**: Development rules and cycle (source of truth)
- **PLANNING.md**: Feature descriptions (input by developer/agent)

### Implementation Folders
- **current/**: Active PRPs to be implemented
- **archive/**: Completed PRPs (preserved for reference)

## Success Metrics

- All PRPs in `current/` are implemented
- All completed PRPs are in `archive/`
- >80% test coverage maintained
- All tests pass consistently
- No interactive commands or hanging processes
- Code quality standards maintained
- Documentation is current and comprehensive
- Archive README.md is updated with new completed features

## Agent Behavior Rules

### DO:
- Read README.md and INIT.md before any work
- Generate comprehensive PRPs with all details
- Implement features completely and thoroughly
- Run tests with `npm run test:run` only
- Move completed PRPs to archive
- Update archive README.md with new completed features
- Maintain high test coverage
- Follow all quality standards

### DON'T:
- Run interactive commands that could hang
- Ask for confirmations or user input
- Use `npm test` (use `npm run test:run`)
- Skip reading README.md and INIT.md
- Leave PRPs incomplete
- Ignore test failures
- Forget to move completed PRPs to archive
- Forget to update archive README.md

This workflow ensures consistent, high-quality development with clear processes and automated completion of feature sets.
