# PRP Implementation Sequence

## Document Types

### Reference Documents (PRP-REF)
- **PRP-REF-UI-Testing-Analysis.md** - Analysis and strategy for unified UI/styling and testing approach

### Implementation Documents (PRP-00 through PRP-08)
The PRP files should be implemented in the following sequence to ensure proper foundation and consistency:

### Phase 0: Foundation (PRP-00)
**PRP-00-Design-System-Testing-Foundation.md**
- Establishes unified UI/styling system
- Sets up comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Creates reusable component library
- Implements accessibility standards
- Provides foundation for all subsequent PRPs

### Phase 1: Project Setup (PRP-01)
**PRP-01-Setup.md**
- Sets up Vite + React + TypeScript
- Configures Tailwind CSS with design system
- Installs Tauri for desktop integration
- Sets up testing dependencies
- Creates basic project structure

### Phase 2: UI Skeleton (PRP-02)
**PRP-02-UI-Skeleton.md**
- Implements basic layout structure
- Creates sidebar, tabs, and editor placeholders
- Uses design system from PRP-00
- Adds comprehensive component tests
- Implements accessibility features

### Phase 3: File System (PRP-03)
**PRP-03-Folder-File-Handling.md**
- Implements folder selection and file tree
- Adds file opening functionality
- Uses consistent UI patterns from foundation
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Tests file system integration

### Phase 4: Tab Management (PRP-04)
**PRP-04-Tabs.md**
- Implements advanced tab system
- Adds drag-and-drop functionality
- Uses design system components
- Tests tab persistence and state
- Implements keyboard navigation

### Phase 5: Editor Integration (PRP-05)
**PRP-05-Editor.md**
- Integrates Monaco Editor
- Implements syntax highlighting
- Uses consistent styling patterns
- Tests editor performance
- Adds accessibility features

### Phase 6: State Management (PRP-06)
**PRP-06-State-Persistence.md**
- Implements state persistence
- Adds auto-save functionality
- Uses consistent error handling
- Tests state migration
- Verifies data integrity

### Phase 7: Packaging (PRP-07)
**PRP-07-Packaging.md**
- Sets up macOS packaging
- Implements code signing
- Adds CI/CD pipeline
- Tests build process
- Verifies deployment

### Phase 8: Architecture Consolidation (PRP-08)
**PRP-08-Architecture-Consolidation.md**
- Unifies state management
- Optimizes performance
- Improves code quality
- Enhances documentation
- Finalizes architecture

## Key Benefits of This Sequence

1. **Foundation First:** PRP-00 establishes all standards and patterns
2. **Consistent Implementation:** All subsequent PRPs use the same design system
3. **Comprehensive Testing:** Testing infrastructure is established early
4. **Progressive Enhancement:** Each phase builds on the previous
5. **Quality Assurance:** Standards are maintained throughout development

## Implementation Checklist

### Before Starting Any PRP:
- [ ] PRP-REF-UI-Testing-Analysis.md has been reviewed
- [ ] PRP-00 foundation is complete
- [ ] Design system is implemented
- [ ] Testing infrastructure is set up
- [ ] Component library is available

### For Each PRP:
- [ ] Reference PRP-REF-UI-Testing-Analysis.md for standards
- [ ] Use design system tokens consistently
- [ ] Follow established component patterns
- [ ] Implement comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Verify performance requirements
- [ ] Document any deviations from standards

## Success Metrics

- **Consistency:** All components follow established patterns
- **Quality:** >80% test coverage across all PRPs
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance:** <100ms component render times
- **Maintainability:** Clear, documented code patterns

This sequence ensures a professional, reliable, and maintainable codebase that follows industry best practices.
