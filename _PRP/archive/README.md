# Archived PRPs - Completed Implementation

This folder contains PRP (Project Requirements & Planning) documents that have been successfully implemented and completed.

## Purpose

- **Preserve Implementation History**: Keep a record of all completed features
- **Reference for Future Development**: Provide examples and patterns for new features
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of what was built
- **Lessons Learned**: Capture insights and approaches used in implementation

## Structure

Completed PRPs are stored here with the new naming convention:

## Naming Convention

Files follow the format: `PRP-[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[number]-[feature].md`

- `[YYYY]`: Four-digit year (2024)
- `[MM]`: Two-digit month (01-12)
- `[DD]`: Two-digit day (01-31)
- `[number]`: Sequential number within the feature set (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- `[feature]`: Descriptive feature name (kebab-case)

This ensures files sort chronologically in the filesystem and provide clear tracking of implementation dates.

## Implementation History

### Areas for Improvement
- **Performance Monitoring**: Could benefit from more detailed metrics
- **Error Handling**: Some edge cases could be handled more gracefully
- **Documentation**: Could include more user-facing documentation
- **Testing**: Could add more E2E tests for complex workflows

## Agent Update Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: When agents complete new PRPs and move them to this archive, they MUST update this README.md file with:

1. **Add new completed features** to the Implementation History section
2. **Update the Structure section** with new file names
3. **Add new achievements** to the Key Achievements section
4. **Update lessons learned** based on new implementations
5. **Maintain chronological order** in the Implementation History

### Template for New Entries:

```markdown
### Phase X: Feature Name (PRP-YYYY-MM-DD-XX)
**Brief Description**
- Key implementation details
- Technical achievements
