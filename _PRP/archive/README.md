## Naming Convention

Files follow the format: `PRP-[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[number]-[feature].md`

- `[YYYY]`: Four-digit year (2024)
- `[MM]`: Two-digit month (01-12)
- `[DD]`: Two-digit day (01-31)
- `[number]`: Sequential number within the feature set (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- `[feature]`: Descriptive feature name (kebab-case)

This ensures files sort chronologically in the filesystem and provide clear tracking of implementation dates.
